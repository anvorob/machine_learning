# Machine learning and Data mining assignment code

# Part A

This task is to predicting the outcome of mortgage applications based on dataset of 700 applications for mortgages for which outcomes are known. It is required to predict outcome of 150 mortgages that have currently being granted.

Decision Trees, Confusion Matrices, Model Visualizations and Summary Statistics are used to explain performance and trends of different parameters values.


# Part B

The data set is from Medical domain and the task is to help predict heart disease for a collection of individuals from whom relevant medical data has been obtained. The objective is to predict whether a given individual will suffer from heart disease (outcome 2) or not (outcome 1) in a year’s time from gathering the data.

Decision Tree Classifier and Naïve Bayes algorithms were used to mine the data. 10 fold cross-validation option was used for testing the performance for both models on testing data.
